# MedForecast
MedForecast is a health prediction system that uses already tested data from medical datasets to help users find the underlying problem with them faster. 

For example, if you have a headache, MedForecast can help you determine whether it is a symptom of a more serious condition. 

MedForecast also provides other features, such as the top 10 trending diseases and a symptom checker.
